# Revealing CT Housing Market Trends with R Shiny

This is an interactive web application that was built with R Shiny, as part of a capstone project in my Data Visualization course. The data was collected from data.gov, and it covers residential real estate sales in Connecticut between the period of 2006 to 2021. The application is comprised of three dashboards: Overview, Regression Analysis, and Geographical Data. Each dashboard uses different visualizations that are built on various subsets of the data to reveal insights into residential real estate market in Connecticut. 

The dashboard can be accessed via this link:
